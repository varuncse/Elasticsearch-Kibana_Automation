# Elasticsearch-Kibana_Automation
Golang scripts to automatically install Elasticsearch-Kibana and all the necessary packages and run the servers irrespective of the OS

Installation process of Elasticsearch and kibana can be gruesome and a tiring process. Starting up the servers simultaneously on the same cluster for elasticsearch and kibana can be confusing.
So to combat this issue I have create an Golang script which will be able to do the above on Operating Systems like Linux, Mac and Windows.
I have even attached the respective Executable files along with setup files for respective OS in folders. Download the folder as by your need and run the exectuable to install and start up the servers at localhost:5601 on your default browser.
